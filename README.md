# 🎧 Advanced SQL Project – Spotify Data Analysis

---

## 📌 Project Overview

<img src="spotify_logo.jpg" alt="Spotify Logo" width="1000"/>

This project is an **advanced SQL-based data analysis** on a real-world **Spotify music dataset**, designed to demonstrate strong proficiency in **SQL querying, data exploration, analytical thinking, and window functions**.

The dataset captures detailed information about songs, artists, albums, audio features, engagement metrics, and streaming platforms. Using this data, the project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **complex analytical queries** to extract meaningful business and musical insights.

This project is structured to reflect **industry-level SQL practices**, including:
- Clean schema design
- Aggregations and filtering
- Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window functions for ranking and partitioned analysis
- Platform comparison (Spotify vs YouTube)
- Feature-based song analysis

The goal is to simulate how a **Data Analyst / Data Engineer** would work with a production-style music analytics database.

## 🗂️ Dataset Description

The Spotify dataset contains:
- Artist and track metadata
- Album information and release types
- Audio features such as energy, danceability, valence, tempo
- Engagement metrics like views, likes, comments
- Streaming statistics across platforms
- Licensing and official video indicators

This rich structure allows both **descriptive analysis** and **advanced analytical queries**.

```

---

## Q1 Retrieve the name of all tracks that have more than 1 billion streams
```sql
SELECT track 
FROM spotify
WHERE stream > 1000000000;
```

## Q2 List all the albums along with their respective artists
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT album, artist
FROM spotify
ORDER BY album;
```

## Q3 Get the total number of comments for tracks where licensed is TRUE
```sql
SELECT SUM(comments) AS total_comments
FROM spotify
WHERE licensed = TRUE;
```

## Q4 Find all tracks that belong to album type SINGLE
```sql
SELECT track
FROM spotify
WHERE album_type = 'single';
```

## Q5 Count the total number of tracks by each artist
```sql
SELECT artist, COUNT(track) AS total_no_song
FROM spotify
GROUP BY artist
ORDER BY total_no_song;
```

---

## Q6 Calculate the average danceability of each album
```sql
SELECT album,
       AVG(danceability) AS avg_danceability
FROM spotify
GROUP BY album
ORDER BY avg_danceability DESC;
```

## Q7 Find the top 5 tracks with highest energy
```sql
SELECT track, energy
FROM spotify
GROUP BY track, energy
ORDER BY energy DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## Q8 List tracks with total views and likes where official_video is TRUE
```sql
SELECT track,
       SUM(views) AS total_views,
       SUM(likes) AS total_likes
FROM spotify
